# OASIS
is a project aimed at freely distributing brain MRI data, including two comprehensive data sets. The sagittal data set includes MRI data of 416 subjects (young, middle-aged, non-demented, and demented older adults) aged between 18 to 96. The longitudinal data set includes MRI data of 150 subjects (non-demented and demented older adults) aged between 60 to 96. It has been described in the following article: https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/19/9/1498/4427/Open-Access-Series-of-Imaging-Studies-OASIS-Cross.

# Alzheimer-MRI
Alzheimer-MRI data set consists of a total of 5,121 axial images. Each image is labelled with the corresponding level of dementia: no dementia, very mild dementia, mild dementia and moderate dementia. The age of the patients is unknown and no other data about them are provided.
The data set includes 2,560 healthy subjects and 2,561 subjects with dementia (1,792 with very mild dementia, 717 with mild dementia, 52 with moderate dementia). Examples are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kaggle}.

# ADNI
ADNI is a project underway since 2004 to follow the progress of AD through its biomarkers in order to diagnose the disease in its early stages. Currently, ADNI is divided into three phases: ADNI1, ADNI GO/2 and ADNI3. ADNI registers participants aged 55-90 years among 57 sites in the United States and Canada.
